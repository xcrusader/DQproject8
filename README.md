Star Wars is a very popular and long standing movie franchise. When the movie Star Wars: The Force Awakens was about to release in the US Five-Thrity Eight released a survey report detailing that the fifth movie in the franchise was the most popular.

In this project we explore the dataset associated to the survey to glean more insights from the dataset. We also investigate the claim that the fifth episode of the franchise was a fan favourite and recreate one of the Five Thirty Eight survey report visualizations using the matplotlib library.

The learning objective in this project was to clean and analyze the dataset and implement all of the knowledge to date in the project.
